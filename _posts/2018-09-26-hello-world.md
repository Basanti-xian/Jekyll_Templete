Hello, my blog!

Why open a blog?
-----------------------------------------------------

If you do it right, **great advertising** for you.

Smart people like to hang out with other smart people. Smart developers like to hang out with smart code. When you open source useful code, you **attract talent**. 

If you're hiring, **the best technical interview possible** is the one you don't have to do because the candidate is already kicking ass on one of your open source projects. 

By getting code out in the public we can drastically **reduce duplication of effort**. Less duplication means more work towards things that matter.

**it's the right thing to do**.



How do I get started?
--------------------------

Easy, just tell the world about your software via your blog, Twitter, Hacker News, and over beers at your local pub. Then sit back, relax, and enjoy being part of something big.
